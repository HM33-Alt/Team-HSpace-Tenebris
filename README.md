## High-Level Summary
The project developed is an interactive website centered on Tenebris, a fictional chemosynthetic ocean planet. Framed as a planetary exploration journal, the website offers insights into the planet's geology, ecosystem, and life forms, all sustained by chemosynthesis. This project addresses the challenge of envisioning life in extreme environments by exploring how ecosystems could thrive in the absence of photosynthesis, inspired by real-world hydrothermal vent ecosystems on Earth. Its importance lies in expanding our understanding of habitable worlds beyond traditional Earth-like conditions, showing how life could exist on planets or moons with subsurface oceans, such as Europa or Enceladus. It explores and reflects my learnings about how extraterrestrial ecosystems would differ from Earth.

## Project Details
**What exactly does it do? / How does it work?**
<br> The project is an interactive website that immerses readers in the exploration of Tenebris, a hypothetical chemosynthetic oceanic planet. The site functions similar to an interactive journal, documenting the planet's geology, ecosystem, flora, and fauna through various pages. It is complemented with AI-generated visuals to enhance the reader's experience. </br>

**What benefits does it have?**
<br> It encourages readers to engage in a thought experiment, broadening their understanding of chemosynthetic ecosystems that thrive without sunlight. This project highlights the diversity of life that could exist beyond Earth and the conditions necessary for such ecosystems to form, while also providing an opportunity to share my curiosity about astrobiology and planetary science. </br>

**What do you hope to achieve?**
<br>The project aims to deepen the reader's appreciation of energy production and conversion processes, such as chemosynthesis, and their critical role in sustaining life. Ultimately, it is using empirical data and a bit of imagination to show that life can exist in extreme and unconventional environments, just as it might on distant worlds nearer to home, like Europa or Enceladus.</br>
