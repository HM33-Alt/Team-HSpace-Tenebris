## Project Details
*Provide additional details about your project. What exactly does it do? How does it work? What benefits does it have? What do you hope to achieve? What tools, coding languages, hardware, or software did you use to develop your project?*
- The concept developed is Tenebris, a hypothetical ocean world where life thrives through chemosynthesis rather than photosynthesis. On Tenebris, carbon-based life forms depend on chemical energy derived from hydrothermal vents and volcanic activity, utilizing compounds like hydrogen sulfide and methane to sustain their ecosystems.
- This concept addresses the challenge by illustrating how life could exist in the absence of sunlight, relying on geological processes to support complex biological communities.
- The importance of this idea lies in its exploration in the understanding of habitability and energy synthesizing processes, suggesting that life could not just survive but thrive in extreme environments (a little closer to home - **Europa** and **Enceladus**).
  
## Use of Artificial Intelligence
*Did you utilize any Artificial Intelligence tools and software in preparing your project? If yes, provide the sources and how you used them. (The answer to this question will not impact the judging of your project.)*
- Yes. **ChatGPT** (for web design help, reading and understanding scientific articles and generating ideas) and **Microsoft Designer** (AI-generated art of Tenebris)

## Space Agency Data
*Please list the resources used. You are welcome to use any open data in your project. However, to be eligible for a Global Award, you must use data or resources from NASA.*
