<h1>Tenebris: An Aquatic Chemosynthetic World</h1>

    <p>
        Tenebris (Latin for <em>darkness</em>) is a hypothetical distant ocean world where carbon-based life forms thrive through chemosynthesis—a process by which organisms harness energy from chemical reactions rather than relying on sunlight. Covering 95% of the planet's surface, the dark oceans are teeming with life around hydrothermal vents, volcanic ridges, and mineral-rich seas, creating a self-sustaining ecosystem. It begins with chemosynthetic bacteria and extremophile organisms like <em>Thermococcus</em> and <em>Methanopyrus</em> converting chemicals into energy through chemosynthesising inorganic compounds such as hydrogen sulfide and methane in the above mentioned extreme environments[1].
    </p>


    <p>
        This idea mirrors Earth’s deep-sea environments, where life has adapted to extreme conditions, such as high pressures and total darkness. As studied by Goffredi et al. (2008), life near hydrothermal vents flourishes in complete darkness, independent of solar energy, which has expanded our understanding of the possible conditions for life beyond Earth[3].
    </p>

    <p>
        Moreover, studies by scientists at NASA on potential ocean worlds, including Europa and Enceladus, indicate that hypothesized life forms like those that exist on Tenebris may exist elsewhere in the universe. These moons are believed to contain subsurface oceans and show evidence of hydrothermal activity, further supporting the hypothesis that chemosynthetic life may not be exclusive to Earth[2][4].
    </p>

    <p>
        The potential for carbon-based life on Tenebris builds on and serves as my own thought experiment geared towards understanding how life could evolve in diverse and extreme conditions across the cosmos. This is the insight the project hopes to create!
