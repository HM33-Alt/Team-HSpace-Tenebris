<h1>Geological Features and Ecosystems</h1>

<p>
Tenebris is a water-dominated exoplanet, drawing comparisons to celestial bodies such as Europa and Enceladus, both of which are believed to harbor subsurface oceans beneath icy crusts. Tenebris's oceans, however, plunge to depths exceeding 100 km, subjecting its marine environment to extreme pressure conditions that significantly shape its geological features and the organisms that inhabit them. These high-pressure environments present both challenges and opportunities for the evolution of life, as species must adapt to the immense pressure, lack of light, and scarcity of traditional energy sources. 
</p>

<p> <strong>Note:</strong> There will be some overlap between ecology and biology but this is due to the fact that both these aspects are intertwined and would be hard to separate. Nevertheless, efforts have been made to create 2 sections to allow for more elaboration and yet remain concise and easy to digest.

<p>
    The ocean floor of Tenebris is characterized by various geological formations, each contributing to the planet's unique ecosystems:
</p>

<p>
<strong>Hydrothermal Vents:</strong> These are fissures in the ocean floor which release heated, mineral-rich water from the planet’s interior, forming the foundation for ecosystems dependent on chemosynthetic bacteria. In such environments, hydrogen sulfide and other chemicals provide the primary energy source for life, bypassing the need for sunlight or photosynthetic processes [1]. Research about Earth's deep-sea hydrothermal vents reveal that chemosynthetic bacteria (including extremophiles which have inspired some of Tenebria's hypothesised lifeforms) sustain thriving ecosystems and it supports the idea that such organisms could also play the same role on Tenebria [2][3].  The discovery of these extremophiles on Earth suggests that life on Tenebris might exhibit similar levels of biodiversity and complexity, driven by the energy and nutrients provided by hydrothermal activity.
</p>
    
<p>
<strong>Volcanic Ridges:</strong> Tenebris's volcanic ridges further enhance the productivity of its deep-sea ecosystems. These ridges release heat and essential minerals into the surrounding water, which can be critical for the survival of chemosynthetic life forms. These ridges also play an important ecological role by creating barriers and localized environments with unique thermal and chemical properties. The gradients in temperature and nutrient concentration across these ridges promote the development of diverse microbial communities, much like those observed around Earth's mid-ocean ridges [4].
</p>

<p>
<strong>Submarine Canyons:</strong> These deep, steep-walled canyons contribute to the movement of water and nutrients across Tenebris’s ocean floor. Much like Earth's continental shelf ecosystems, where nutrient upwelling drives biological productivity, Tenebris's submarine canyons support the circulation of nutrient-rich waters from the deep ocean to the surface layers. This promotes an abundance of resources for a wide variety of life forms to thrive even at such deep depths, much like what we see with regions possessing significant upwelling such as the coasts of California in the United States [4]. Similarly, Tenebrian submarine canyons likely would play a crucial role in sustaining its marine ecosystems by ensuring the availability of nutrients.
