<h1>Tenebris: An Aquatic Chemosynthetic World</h1>

<p>
Tenebris (Latin for <em>darkness</em>) is a hypothetical distant ocean world where carbon-based life forms thrive through chemosynthesisâ€”a process by which organisms harness energy from chemical reactions rather than relying on sunlight. Covering 95% of the planet's surface, the dark oceans are teeming with life around hydrothermal vents, volcanic ridges, and mineral-rich seas, creating a self-sustaining ecosystem.
</p>

<p>
It begins with chemosynthetic bacteria and extremophile organisms converting chemicals into energy through chemosynthesising inorganic compounds such as hydrogen sulfide and methane in the extreme underwater environment of Tenebris. This is inspired by Earth's very own deep-sea hydrothermal environments, where life has adapted and flourishes amidst high pressure and near total and/or complete darkness. [1] [2].
</p>

<p>
Moreover, studies by scientists at NASA on potential ocean worlds, including Europa and Enceladus, indicate that hypothesized life forms like those that exist on Tenebris may exist elsewhere in the universe. These moons are believed to contain subsurface oceans and show evidence of hydrothermal activity, further supporting the hypothesis that chemosynthetic life may not be exclusive to Earth [3] [4].

<p>
The project reflects my own learnings about astronomy, biology, chemistry and everything in-between. On a broader scale, it serves as my own thought experiment about how life can survive and thrive in different environments and if so, what are the key ingredients. This is the insight the project hopes to produce!
